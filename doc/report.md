Objectives
----------

-   What did you do to complete this lab?
-   What components were you learning about?
-   Why do you think we made you do this lab?
-   Aim for 5-12 bullet points

Software Design
---------------

// Create a call graph and dataflow graph to accurately reflect your code.
// An example of a dataflow graph is included at the end of the procedure
// section. [draw.io](draw.io) and [inkscape](inkscape.org) are some options for
// creating .svg files.

Extra Credit
------------

// If you did any of the extra credit options, provide implementation
// information here, otherwise remove this section.
// Please provide a circuit diagram if you did the hardware extra credit.

Analysis and Discussion
-----------------------

// Follow the link in the deliverables section of the lab document and read the
// article, then fill out the following questions

1. *In the client server paradigm, explain the sequence of internet communications sent from client to server and from server to client as the client saves data on the server. Assume the client already is connected to the WiFi AP and the client knows the IP address of the server.*

	Answer goes here

2. *What is the purpose of the DNS?*

	

3. *What is the difference between UDP and TCP communication? More specifically when should we use UDP and when should we use TCP?*
